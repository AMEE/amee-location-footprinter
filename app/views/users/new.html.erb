  <h3>CO42  gives you an estimate of the carbon emissions associated with your foursquare check ins.</h3>
    
    <p>Based on the distance travelled between checkins, we make a few (fairly basic) assumptions about your mode of transport and the associated carbon emissions.</p>  

  <p style="width:240px;">Each week you get an email summary of your emissions and we hope itâ€™ll make you think about how you get around. CO42 is powered by AMEE - check out www.amee.com for more details</p>
